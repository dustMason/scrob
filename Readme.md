> Sends info about music you play in iTunes on your mac to our top secret collection facility.

To install, clone this repo to your mac:

    git clone https://github.com/dustMason/scrob.git

Then double click the `install.command` file in the directory you just grabbed. You will be asked for a username - this will identify you on the website. You'll then be prompted for your Mac OS X user password so that the script can set up a background process which monitors iTunes.

Running `uninstall.command` reverses these changes and kills the background process.
